<h2 id="course-description">COURSE DESCRIPTION<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#course-description"></a>
</h2>
<p>Quantitative models play a central role in linking data to inferences
about ecological processes. Although quantitative ecological modeling
involves a diverse array of questions and techniques, many of the most
common modeling frameworks are based on a set of general underlying
principles. This course aims to provide students with a firm
understanding of these principles and their application, with a
particular focus on modeling the dynamics of plant and animal
populations using Bayesian methods. By building from common principles
to more specific procedures, students will be better equipped to tailor
analyses to their specific data and questions, ultimately leading to
deeper and more robust understanding of the ecological systems they
study. Concepts discussed during lectures will be reinforced through lab
exercises focused on implementing statistical models using modern
software tools (e.g. R, Nimble, and git).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="course-objectives">COURSE OBJECTIVES<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#course-objectives"></a>
</h2>
<p>The primary objective of this course is to give you the tools to
tackle your research questions using rigorous statistical models
appropriate for your data. In particular, you will leave this course
with:</p>
<ul>
<li>A firm understanding of the foundational principles underlying
common ecological models<br>
</li>
<li>The ability to express mathematical and theoretical models as they
apply to common ecological datasets<br>
</li>
<li>The ability to convert those models into working code for Bayesian
data analysis<br>
</li>
<li>The confidence needed to design, analyze, and report original
ecological research using sound quantitative approaches</li>
</ul>
<p>A secondary objective of this course is to provide you with tools and
best practices for storing, manipulating, and analyzing ecological data
and developing reproducible code for analyses. In my experience, most
graduate students are well trained in methods for data collection and,
to a degree, data analysis. However, most students do not receive formal
training on the steps between data collection and reporting results from
statistical models (e.g., proofing, storing, and formatting data;
developing well-documented, reproducible analyses; preparing reports).
Advancing the field of ecology also requires a scientific community
capable of judging the quality of the code, interpretation, reporting of
quantitative models. Graduate students often get few opportunities to
critically review the work of their peers or to get constructive
feedback on their reviews. The lab portion of this course is
specifically designed to provide you with hands on experience with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best practices for cleaning, formatting, and storing data using
R</li>
<li>Generating reproducible analyses and reports using R and R
Markdown</li>
<li>Providing critical peer review of scientific code and reports</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="learning-outcomes">LEARNING OUTCOMES<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#learning-outcomes"></a>
</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Understand common deterministic and stochastic models used to
analyze ecological data</li>
<li>Understand key principles of linear models, including design
matrices, linear predictors, and model interpretations</li>

posterior sampling</li>
<li>Understand the concepts underlying Bayesian hierarchical models,
including fixed vs. random effects, hyperparameters, and shrinkage</li>
<li>Develop custom Bayesian models using MCMC software (e.g., Nimble) to
estimate parameter values and derived quantities of interest for common
ecological processes</li>

<h2 id="prerequisites">PREREQUISITES<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#prerequisites"></a>
</h2>
<p>Students should have at least one semester of both basic ecology and
introductory statistics. Although we will thoroughly cover the
foundational principles of common statistical models, a basic
understanding of ecological theory and statistical inference will be
very helpful.</p>
<p>All lab activities for this course will rely heavily on the
statistical programming language R (and associated software, including
RStudio, Nimble, and git). During the first few weeks, each lab session
will begin with a tutorial on these tools so students are not expected
to be experts prior to the course. However, we will quickly move into
activities that require some degree of R proficiency so we highly
recommend that you have a basic understanding of programming in R (e.g.,
importing/exporting &amp; manipulating data objects, visualizing data)
prior to this course. If you find yourself struggling with any aspects
of using R, please seek individual help during office hours. The earlier
we can get you up to speed, the more painless the remainder of the
semester will be.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="course-format">COURSE FORMAT<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#course-format"></a>
</h2>
<p>This course will be taught using both lectures and labs. Lectures
will focus on the conceptual basis of ecological modeling and Bayesian
methods. Labs are designed to reinforce and clarify lecture topics,
allowing students to get hands-on experience manipulating, analyzing,
and visualizing data. All class materials, including lecture slides,
computer code, lab documents, and data, will be posted on the course
website prior to class.</p>

<h3 id="textbooks">Textbooks<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#textbooks"></a>
</h3>
<p>Although there are many excellent texts covering various aspects of
ecological modeling, the lectures for this course will closely follow
two:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hobbs, N.T. and M.B. Hooten, 2015. <em>Bayesian Models: A Statistical
Primer for Ecologists</em> (available <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Models-Statistical-Primer-Ecologists/dp/0691159289/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459363878&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=bayesian+models+a+statistical+primer+for+ecologists" class="external-link">here</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Kéry, M. and M. Schaub, 2011. <em>Bayesian population analysis using
WinBUGS: A hierarchical perspective</em> (available <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Population-Analysis-using-WinBUGS/dp/0123870208" class="external-link">here</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weekly readings will be assigned from these books so we highly
recommend all students purchase them prior to the start of the semester.
The Kéry &amp; Schaub book also contains a wealth of useful code that,
although optional, students are encouraged to implement as they read the
text. Chapters from these books may occasionally be supplemented with
primary journal articles. When applicable PDF’s of these articles will
be posted on the course website.</p>
<p>Although the two text books and lab materials are sufficient for
mastering the material presented in this course, a number of other
excellent books are available and students may find some/all of these
books helpful. The following books are 100% optional for this course but
we have found helpful for learning this material:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kéry, M. &amp; Royle, J.A. 2016. <em>Applied Hierarchical Modeling in
Ecology: Analysis of distribution, abundance, and species richness in R
and BUGS</em>. Academic Press.</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="lab-materials">Lab materials<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#lab-materials"></a>
</h3>
<p>Materials for labs will be provided as HTML and R Markdown files on
the course webpage. These materials will include step-by-step tutorials
for all lab exercises as well as links to additional online resources,
problem sets, and homework assignments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="software">Software<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#software"></a>
</h3>
<p>All lab computers will have R and RStudio installed on them so
students are not required to install software on their own computers.
However, students are free to use their own laptops during lab and
having R and RStudio installed will make it easier to complete lab
assignments outside of class. Any students wishing to use their own
computers <strong>should have R, RStudio, and JAGS installed and running
prior to the first lab</strong>. Detailed instructions for installing R
and RStudio can be found <a href="http://stat545.com/block000_r-rstudio-install.html" class="external-link">here</a>. JAGS
can be downloaded <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/" class="external-link">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you plan to use your own computer, <strong>be sure you have the
most recent versions of all three software programs installed</strong>.
This will greatly decrease the chances of running to issue running the
code I will provide in lab. Prior to the start of the semester, test
that you have R and RStudio installed correctly by doing the
following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Launch RStudio</p></li>
<li><p>Put the cursor in the window labelled <code>Console</code>. Type
the following code followed by enter or return:
<code>x &lt;- 2 * 4</code>. Next type <code>x</code> followed by enter
or return. You should see the value 8 print to screen. If yes, you’ve
succeeded in installing R and RStudio.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you encounter any problems with the previous steps, please contact
the instructors prior to the first class.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="attendance">ATTENDANCE<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#attendance"></a>
</h2>
<p>As graduate students who willingly signed up for this course, we
presume that you are eager to learn the material and are self-motivated
enough to put in the required effort. For this reason, we do not set a
formal attendance policy. However, we will cover a lot of material over
the course of the semester and each topic will build on concepts from
previous weeks. As a result, missing even a few lectures or labs will
make it difficult for you to fully master the learning outcomes
described above. If you know you will be missing any lectures or labs,
please contact us in advance so we can make sure you do not get too far
behind on the material.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="a-note-on-fieldwork">A note on fieldwork<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#a-note-on-fieldwork"></a>
</h4>
<p>We realize that many students have field work obligations during the
spring semester. If you need to take this course but know in advance
that you will be in the field for a portion of the semester, please let
us know ASAP so we can discuss whether field work will be a barrier to
taking the course or merely an inconvenience. This distinction will
mainly be a function of how long and when you will miss class. If these
absences are relatively few, taking the course may still be an option.
Students will still be expected to complete and turn in any assignments
they miss. If you are going to miss too many classes or will be unable
to complete the assignments while you’re in the field, it may be better
to take the class at a time when your field commitments are smaller.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="grading">GRADING<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#grading"></a>
</h2>
<p>Your grade in the course will be based on a total of 200 possible
points. Thirty five percent of your grade (70 points) will come from 7
homework assignments. Twenty five percent of your grade (50 points) will
come from a midterm exam covering the topics we discuss in lecture
during the first half of the semester. The final 40% (80 points) will be
based on an individual project due at the end of the semesters.</p>
<p>The 7 homework assignments will build on concepts and skills that we
cover in lecture and lab. Specific objectives and tasks for each
assignment, along with any necessary data, will be posted on the course
website. In general, students will be provided with ‘raw’ data and will
need to clean/prepare (and document!) data prior to analysis. Each
assignment will be due before class the week after the assignment is
posted. All assignments must be prepared as R Markdown files that
include all text, code, model output, and figures necessary to fully
document your work and conclusions (we will spend the first several labs
going over preparation of reports using R Markdown so, again, no
previous experience is necessary). See <a href="https://rushinglab.github.io/WILD8370/articles/homework.html" class="external-link">here</a>
for instructions on submitting assignment</p>
<p>Individual projects may address an ecological question of your
choosing, but must be approved by me during the first half of the
semester. You are free to use any data you have access to, including
data from your own projects, published datasets, or even simulated data.
Once the project topic and data are approved, you are expected to
develop statistical models using the tools and skill gained during the
semester to gain insights into the ecological processes that generated
your data. Once completed, a final report should be prepared as if you
were submitting the results to a short-format scientific journal.
Additionally, you will give a short oral presentation of your results
during the final week of class as if you were presenting at a
professional conference. Later in the semester, I will provide a rubric
for how the written and oral reports will be assessed.</p>
