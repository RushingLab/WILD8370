## Review

Lots of parameters of potential interest in these models

- $\phi$ = probability of survival 

- $\gamma$ = biologically meaningless parameter indicating if you are 'removed' from the available population 

- $N_t$ = realized abundance in time $t$

- $N_s$ = total number of individuals ever alive (superpopulation)

- $B_t$ = realized recruits in time $t$

- $b_t$ = probability of being recruited in time $t$ given that you ARE recruited at some point from time $t = 1$ to time $t = T$ (semi-meaningless biologically)

- $\psi$ = proportion of the total augmented population (real + imaginary) that are real

- $f = \frac{B_t}{N_t}$ = per capita realized recruitment

## "POPAN Style" Superpopulation Model 



---
## Pros and Cons - POPAN 

One limitation of the POPAN data type is with the use of individual covariates.  

Super-populations size (N) estimates the number of animals never captured, this parameter includes animals for which the individual covariate is not known.  Thus, modeling N as a function of individual covariates is inappropriate. 

---
## Pros and Cons - General 

####Regardless of parameterization, fully time-dependent models are hard 

In a fully time-dependent model (both $p$ and $\phi$ vary with time) 

    + Cannot separately estimate first entry probability and first capture probability 
    
    + Cannot separately estimate last surival and last capture probability without robust design

## Other Models Exist

  + Pradel Model (reverse-time formulation)
  
  + Link-Barker Model (allows for direct prior on per-capita fecundity)
  
  + Multi-state Formulation
