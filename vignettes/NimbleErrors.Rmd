Some notes to self:

> Defining model Error in processBUGScode(recurseCode, nextContextID, lineNumber = lineNumber, : invalid model code: N_AH[t] = N_BH[t] - H[t]

This error is caused by using an = instead of a \<-

> Warning: R object of different size than NimArrDouble. R obj has size 1 but NimArrDbl has size 10.

Caused by giving an initial value that has the wrong array dimensions. Oops!
