In this activity we'll practice running both a spatial and non-spatial mark recapture model on some data. 


## Butterflies!

Today's dataset is on a study of false heath fritillary butterflies (*Melitaea diamina*) conducted in Finland. You can find more details about this study here:

Fabritius, H., Rönkä, K. & Ovaskainen, O. The dual role of rivers in facilitating or hindering movements of the false heath fritillary butterfly. Mov Ecol 3, 4 (2015). https://doi.org/10.1186/s40462-015-0031-z

The full study uses three datasets but today we will be only using the data from 1995.
