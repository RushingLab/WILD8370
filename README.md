# Welcome to WILD8370: Bayesian Models for Conservation Science

This is the unofficial course website for the Spring 2025 offering of **WILD8370: Bayesian Models for Conservation Science** at the University of Georgia. The "official" course website (for students enrolled in the course) is on eLC.  

The goal of this website is to create a central repository for students to access all course materials - lecture slides, lab activities, code, data, etc. A secondary goal is to make those materials freely available to other students and instructors who may find them useful. If you encounter any issues or have any suggestions, feel free to contact me at clark.rushing [at] uga [dot] edu.     

General course information can be found by clicking on the `Syllabus` and `Schedule` links above. Lecture slides and lab activities can be accessed using the drop down menus. 


## Course R package

In addition to this website, materials from the course will be distributed through an `R` package called *WILD8370*. The main purpose of the package is to distribute code and data that will used for labs, though eventually additional materials may be included, including lectures and reference documents. You can install the most current version of *WILD8370* with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RushingLab/WILD8370")
```


## Use of material  

Materials included in this course is purposefully made available to anyone who finds it useful. Users are free to use, adapt, distribute, display, and communicate these materials freely. If you find these materials useful, please let me know, especially if you are using or adapting these materials for teaching. Tracking use of these materials outside of the official course is not only great validation for my effort, it helps me demonstrate "a positive professional reputation in teaching."
